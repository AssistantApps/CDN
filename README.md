This repo just holds some static assets, its not much to look at but a lot of the web assets will likely use these assets so that it is easy to change icons from one place ðŸ˜‹

### Migration work
_As part of the Oct 2022 migration, all the files on the CDN have been placed here although some folders should only be here temporarily. The `Translation` and `uploads` folders will be moved to a new location_
